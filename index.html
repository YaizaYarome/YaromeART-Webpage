                  Welcome to my lair, adventurer!<br /><br />
                  My name is Yaiza, I'm 25 years old, and I'm a
                  <strong>digital artist</strong>. What do I do? I make
                  illustrations, designs, concept art, sketches... You know,
                  that artsy magic. <br />
                  <br />
                  Basically, I sit here for hours until I get that beautiful
                  painting you asked me for exactly as you envisioned it. I'll
                  ask you for some feedback, of course, but mostly, I'll use
                  that portal over there, get some art demon to help and... Bam!
                  Commission done.<br />
                  <br />
                  I've been working on my own in this endeavour the past 7
                  years, and I'm specialized in working with first-time
                  commissioners. You simply need to put your name in the portal,
                  give some instructions about what kind of portrait you want,
                  talk a bit about that character... and I'll translate your
                  words into the visual creation you want.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  What do you say? Would you look at my previous work, or are you ready to make your first pact?

                They seem to be choices, different paths you can take to make your pact. Of course, to get, you must also give, 
                so there's also a message that shows what do you have to exange for the pact. Thankfully, it doesn't have to do with
                your first child, your soul or your eternal servitude.

                <p> Halfbody with soft colored lines. Best suited for references with expressive posing to showcase the mood or attitude of your character. </p>

                <h3> Full </h3>

                <img class="ImgThumbnail" src="images/commissions/full.png" alt="Full Style"/>
                <p> Full body in semi-realistic style with plenty of details. Complex poses are perfect in this style, with dynamic scenes and bigger sizes to use as wallpaper or print as a poster.</p>

                <p> Where does the action takes place: in a big, dusty castle? Is it a forest with thousands of fireflies floating around? Or is it the inside of a steampunk factory? 
                  <br> Solid colors or gradients with textures are free, but commissions with complex scenery take a bit of extra time. If you want your character to be portrayed in a specific setting, you need to take this extra. The price is an estimation that varies depending on the complexity of the background.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="commission-item armor">
                <h3>Armor</h3>
                <h4>15€~??€</h4>
                <p>Clothing can be an important part of the design of a character: it can show the status, personality, mood, age... Sometimes a simple garb will suffice for a character that doesn't really need fancy clothes to fulfill their mission, but other times you will need a heavy armor or fancy dress to attend to a ball. 
                  <br> Simple clothes will not be considered an extra, but if you want something specially ellaborated for a particular commission, you need to check this extra. Depending on the complexity and if the clothes have to be designed or are already created in a previous piece, the price will vary.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="commission-item weapons">
                <h3>Weapons</h3>
                <h4>15€~??€</h4>
                <p>Will your character take anything that they find on the road or will they have an unique weapon their significant other gifted them before dying? Is there a special staff that they need to search for and you wanted it portrayed in your commission? Custom weapons can be an important part of the quest or design of a character, so you can ask me to design or include an already existing item to the piece. Depending on the complexity, number of weapons and if the item has to be designed or not, the price will vary.</p>
              </div>
              <h2>What if...?</h2>
              <div class="commission-item">
              <p>Sometimes none of the styles or extras I've showed you will suffice. Maybe you need a special commission done before a date, maybe you need a format in particular (a comic, a header for a webpage, a logotype) and you are not sure how much will it take, in terms of both money and time.

              <div class="question">
              <h2> How do I commission a piece?</h2>
              <p> Below you will find a formulary with all the data that is required to make a commission. You only need to fill every section and wait for the confirmation email. The confirmation email will include questions that may appear regarding your piece, changes if they're necessary and an estimation of the full price of the commission. After the price is settled, I'll send an invoice and you just need to pay and wait for updates that will be sent to your email. Basic commissions will only receive one 'work in progress' picture, while more complex commissions will require more communication between us to ensure everything is perfect.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="question">
                <h2> I didn't receive the confirmation email, what should I do?</h2>
                <p> The process is not automated, I answer each email personally, so sometimes it will take a few days to get a confirmation. If your commission has an urgent deadline, don't worry, I answer the urgent commission emails first. If you don't receive a confirmation email after a week, contact me again with other email or through my social media. <strong>I will not answer questions related to commissions through social media, only problems related to the confirmation email. </strong></p>
              </div>
            
              <div class="question">
                <h2> How do I pay for a commmission? </h2>
                <p> All payments are made via Paypal only. After we have settled a price for the commission, I will send a Paypal invoice with the full price of the piece, including all extras needed.</p>

              <div class="question">
                <h2> How long will it take for my commission to be finished? </h2>
                <p> Depending on my workload and the complexity of your commission, it will take from one day to a few weeks to finish your piece. To ensure your commission is finished before a special date, you can add a deadline for an extra fee. If your commission hasn't started being done and you feel that it's taking too long, you're entitled to a full refund before I start working on it. I will periodically send screenshots of the piece while I'm working on it, so please be patient about it: if more than a week has passed without any emails regarding the status of your commission after I started working on it, you can send an email to ask for updates. Please refrain from sending several emails about the status of the piece. </p>

              <div class="question">
                <h2> Why did someone name appear on top of my spot in the waitlist? </h2>
                <p> Commissions are usually first come first serve, but sometimes there are urgent commissions (birthdays, holidays, weddings, etc.) that need to be done as soon as possible. Urgent commissions will be marked with an exclamation icon, and will appear in the upper spots of the list, and have an extra fee.</p>

              <div class="question">
                <h2> How do I cancel a commission? </h2>
                <p> You can simply send an email with your name and commission type and ask for a commission cancel.</p>
              </div>
            
              <div class="question">
                <h2> How do refunds work? </h2>
                  <p>If you have already paid half or the total price of the commission, and I've started working on your piece, we will need to discuss the percentage of the commission you will be refunded.   This is done this way because of the ammount of work done: it's not the same to refund a piece that I'm still sketching than one that is halfway in the coloring phase. All refunds will be  made through paypal I will not refund finished pieces after they have been finished, though you're entlited to make small changes to adjust the final piece.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong> Any attempt to try to get a full refund from Paypal of a piece that has been finished will be considered a scam.</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  If you're not happy about your commission or you have any problem with the final product, please contact me through my email and we will discuss it to reach a solution. Any suspicion of a scam will prevent you from making further commissions and will start legal action against the scammer.</p>
