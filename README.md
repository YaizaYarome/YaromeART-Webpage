# YaromeART-Webpage - 2020

Webpage made as an exercise to work with HTML5 and CSS3 with some Javascript content.

Features:

- Mobile first approach with media queries.
- Responsive header with fullscreen nav in mobile devices.
- Text and buttons animations.
- Parallax background.
- Responsive grid gallery.
- Responsive flexbox items.
- Formulary with regular expressions.

The menus and design have redundancy flaws and accessibility issues, please remember this is an exercise and the webpage is not actually operational at the moment.
If you encounter any bugs or do you have any suggestions to improve/fix the exercise, feedback is very appreciated.
